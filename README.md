# Reaction-Diffusion Modeling of Vascular Tumor Growth: Numerical Bifurcation, Relapse, and Therapy Efficacy
   This repository contains MATLAB code for simulating a reaction-diffusion model of vascular cancer . The system includes five interacting components with the presence of diffusion for four of the components. This RD model is used to investigate tumor growth dynamics and therapy efficacy in different stages of cancer. The model enables bifurcation analysis under varying biological and treatment parameters.

##  How to Run the code

1. Open MATLAB.
2. Run the .m files in each folder: Use the pde codes file for the pde simulations and the numerical simulation codes file to simulate the numerical bifurcation simulations. 
3. For the numerical birfucation:  Modify cases == 1 or cases == 2 to toggle between parameter sweep types:
cases = 1: For paramter r  or Cases = 2: For parameter s
Numerical Bifurcation codes.zip

For the pde simulations: 
 pdepe handles space-time adaptive meshing
 
4. View and save the output plots.

 * Please make sure the PDE Toolbox is installed in MATLAB.*
MATLAB R2021a or later
No external toolboxes required
